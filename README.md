A simple task logger for osx

As often as you feel is needed, a popup asks what you are doing, and logs it.

Dialog provided by http://mstratman.github.io/cocoadialog/ and this is thus a dependency for this project.

Also notifications by terminal-notifier, which must be installed - https://github.com/alloy/terminal-notifier

Storage is done in an sqlite3 db.
